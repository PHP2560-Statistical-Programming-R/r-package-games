# Games Package
r-package-games created by GitHub Classroom

We will create a Games package.

## Brian - Boggle

## Olivia - Tic-Tac-Toe

## Anna - Uno

## Linde - Solitaire
For my part of the package, I will simulate the classic Solitaire card game, played with 52 cards. I will simulate the results from both a 1-deal (unveil 1 card from deck each time) and 3-deal (unveil 3 cards from deck each time) versions. I will then run simulations of this game a large number of times and examine the distribution of the results.
